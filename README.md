# Using ChatGPT4 to learn rust

## premise

I couldn't find a rust tutorial that really worked with my learning style so I decided to
prompt ChaGPT to act as my coach and provide a couple projects that could be tackled with a
little research and grade me on my code. this repo represents the projects. the GPT prompt
and feedback will be comments at the top and bottom of each project.
